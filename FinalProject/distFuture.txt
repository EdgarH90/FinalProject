VJ-23X of Lameth stared into the black depths of the three-dimensional,
small-scale map of the Galaxy and said, "Are we ridiculous,
I wonder, in being so concerned about the matter?"
MQ-17J of Nicron shook his head. "I think not. You know the Galaxy will
be filled in five years at the present rate of expansion."

"Still," said VJ-23X, "I hesitate to submit a pessimistic
 report to the Galactic Council."

"I wouldn't consider any other kind of report. 
 Stir them up a bit. We've got to stir them up."

VJ-23X sighed. "Space is infinite. A hundred billion Galaxies are
 there for the taking. More."

"A hundred billion is not infinite and it's getting less infinite
 all the time. Consider! Twenty thousand years ago, mankind first
 solved the problem of utilizing stellar energy, and a few centuries later, 
 interstellar travel became possible. It took mankind a million years to
 fill one small world and then only fifteen thousand years to fill
 the rest of the Galaxy. Now the population doubles every ten years --"

VJ-23X interrupted. "We can thank immortality for that."

"A very good point. Already, mankind consumes two sunpower units per year."

"Most of it's wasted. After all, our own Galaxy alone pours out a 
thousand sunpower units a year and we only use two of those."

"We'll just have to build new stars out of interstellar gas."

"Or out of dissipated heat?" asked MQ-17J, sarcastically.

"There may be some way to reverse entropy. We ought to ask the Galactic AC."

VJ-23X was not really serious, but MQ-17J pulled out his AC-contact from
 his pocket and placed it on the table before him.

"I've half a mind to," he said. "It's something the human race will have to face someday."

MQ-17J asked suddenly of his AC-contact, "Can entropy ever be reversed?"

The sound of the Galactic AC startled them into silence. Its voice came thin and beautiful
 out of the small AC-contact on the desk. It said:

 THERE IS INSUFFICIENT DATA FOR A MEANINGFUL ANSWER.
