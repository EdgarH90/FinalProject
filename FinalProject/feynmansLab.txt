The year is now 2030. With the help of the Univac,
humans have been able to harness the power of the sun.

You tell Dr. Feynman, "We did it! Thanks to the Univac,
we will have enough energy to last us forever!"

Dr. Feynman replies, "Not forever".

"Ok, well just about! At least till the sun runs down"

"That's not forever." 

"All right, but now we can hook up each individual 
spaceship to the Solar Station, and it can go to Pluto
and back a million times without ever worrying about fuel.
You can't do THAT on coal and uranium."

"Yes, but when the sun is done, the other stars 
will be gone, too. The sun will last twenty billion years
and maybe the dwarfs will last a hundred billion for all
the good they are. But just give us a trillion years and 
everything will be dark. Entropy has to increase to maximum,
that's all," Dr. Feynman replied.

"I know all about entropy," you said.

"Then you know everything's got to run down someday,"
replied Dr. Feynman.

"All right. Who says they won't?"

"You just did. You said we had all the energy we needed,
forever. You said 'forever.'"

"Maybe we can build things up again someday," you said.

"Never."

"Why not? Someday."

"Never."

"Ask the Univac."

Growing increasingly frustrated, you were on the verge of
walking out of the lab.

You think to yourself, "How could the net amount of
entropy of the universe be massively decreased?"
