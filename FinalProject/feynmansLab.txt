The year is now 2030. With the help of the Univac,
humans have been able to harness the power of the sun.

You tell Dr. Feynman, "We did it! Thanks to the Univac,
we will have enough energy to last us forever!"

Dr. Feynman replies, "Not forever".

"Ok, well just about! At least till the sun runs down"

"That's not forever." 

"All right, but now we can hook up each individual 
spaceship to the Solar Station, and it can go to Pluto
and back a million times without ever worrying about fuel.
You can't do THAT on coal and uranium."

"Yes, but when the sun is done, the other stars 
will be gone, too. The sun will last twenty billion years
and maybe the dwarfs will last a hundred billion for all
the good they are. But just give us a trillion years and 
everything will be dark. Entropy has to increase to maximum,
that's all."", Dr. Feynman replied.

"I know what entropy is..."
