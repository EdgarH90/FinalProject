"That's X-23 on the Visiplate," said Jerrodd confidently.

Jerrodine said, ""I can't help it. I feel funny about
leaving Earth."

"So many stars, so many planets," sighed Jerrodette,
their daughter. "I suppose families will be going out
to new planets forever, the way we are now."

"Not forever," said Jerrodd, with a smile.
"It will all stop someday, but not for billions of years.
Many billions. Even the stars run down, you know. Entropy must increase."

"What's entropy, daddy?" shrilled Jerrodette.

"Entropy, little sweet, is just a word which means the amount
of running-down of the universe. Everything runs down, you know,
like your little walkie-talkie robot, remember?"

"Can't you just put in a new power-unit, like with my robot?"

The stars are the power-units, dear. Once they're gone,
there are no more power-units."

Jerrodette I at once set up a howl. "Don't let them, daddy.
Don't let the stars run down."

"Now look what you've done, " whispered Jerrodine, exasperated.

"How was I to know it would frighten her?" Jerrodd whispered back.

"Ask the Microvac," wailed Jerrodette I. "Ask him how
to turn the stars on again."

He asked the Microvac, adding quickly, "Print the answer."

Jerrodd cupped the strip of thin cellufilm and said cheerfully,
"See now, the Microvac says it will take care of everything when
 the time comes so don't worry."

Jerrodine said, "and now, it's time for bed. We'll be in our new home soon."

Jerrodd read the words on the cellufilm again before destroying it:
