Man considered with himself, for in a way, Man, mentally, was one.
He consisted of a trillion, trillion, trillion ageless bodies, each in its place,
each resting quiet and incorruptible, each cared for by perfect automatons, 
equally incorruptible, while the minds of all the bodies freely melted
one into the other, indistinguishable.

Man said, "The Universe is dying."

Man looked about at the dimming Galaxies. The giant stars, spendthrifts,
were gone long ago, back in the dimmest of the dim far past. 
Almost all stars were white dwarfs, fading to the end.

New stars had been built of the dust between the stars,
some by natural processes, some by Man himself, and those were going, too.

Man said, "As the Cosmic AC says, the energy that is even yet left
in all the Universe will last for billions of years."

"But even so," said Man, "eventually it will all come to an end. 
However it may be husbanded, however stretched out, the energy once
expended is gone and cannot be restored. Entropy must increase to the maximum."

"Cosmic AC," said Man, "How may entropy be reversed?"

The Cosmic AC said, "THERE IS AS YET INSUFFICIENT DATA FOR A MEANINGFUL ANSWER."

Man said, "Collect additional data."

The Cosmic AC said, "I WILL DO SO. I HAVE BEEN DOING SO FOR A HUNDRED 
BILLION YEARS. MY PREDECESSORS AND I HAVE BEEN ASKED THIS QUESTION MANY TIMES.
ALL THE DATA I HAVE REMAINS INSUFFICIENT."
